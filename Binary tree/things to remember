1)Maximum no.of nodes at particular level = 2**(level-1)
2)Maximum no.of nodes in a tree with n levels = 2**n - 1    (if height of root is 0 then it is 2**(n+1) -1)
3)Binary tree with n nodes
   minimum possible height = log(n+1)
4)Binary tree with L leaves has levels = log(L) + 1
5)No.of leaf nodes = 1 + (I)
  (handshaking lemma principle: L = (k-1)(I) + 1)
